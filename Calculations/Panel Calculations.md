# Panel Calculations

## Inverter Output Amps
At 240V (standard split phase voltage), inverter maximum outputs:

* Sunny Boy 6.0-US: 25A
* Sunny Boy 3.0-US: 12.5A

## Single 6.0-US
The output of a single 6.0-US is run into a breaker on the main outside panel busbar, between the house lugs and the 200A main breaker.  125% the rated output (31.25A) is fed into a 35A breaker to backfeed the busbar.

A 120% rating on a 200A busbar allows for up to 240A of feed.  A 35A breaker plus an unmodified 200A main breaker works within this limit.

The disconnect is using a 25A breaker, rated for operation at 100% continuous load.


## 6.0-US and 3.0-US
The panel has a totally separate 50A slot, wired back to the meter separately from the main busbar.  There are no limitations on backfeeding with this.

For these two inverters, they come together in a combiner/disconnect.  In the disconnect/combiner, for the 6.0-US, a 25A breaker is used, and the 3.0-US uses a 15A breaker.  Both are rated for 100% continuous operation.

Combining the inverter output ratings, (25 + 12.5) * 1.25 = 46.87A.  A 50A breaker in the separate slot provides protection for this backfeed.
